# Introduction

<p>This project analyzes National Identification Number (NIN) enrollment data across Nigerian states and compares enrollment counts with projected population figures.  </p>The National Identification Number (NIN) is a unique identifier issued by the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) to Nigerian citizens and legal residents. </p>As a foundational identity system, NIN enrollment coverage is critical for effective service delivery, governance, and demographic planning.The objective of this analysis is to assess enrollment coverage gaps across states, examine gender disparities in enrollment, identify anomalies where total enrollments exceed projected population figures, and explore structural factors such as diaspora records and reporting boundaries that may influence these outcomes.
